# **Applies Data Science Capstone**
## About this course
This is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate as well as the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization. This capstone project course will give you the chance to practice the work that data scientists do in real life when working with datasets.  <br>
In this course you will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model.
<br>
## Week-1
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this module, you will be provided with an overview of the problem and the tools you need to complete the course.<br>
**Learning Objectives**<br>
- Write Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas data frame
- Convert a JSON file into a Create a Python Pandas data frame by converting a JSON file
- Create a Jupyter notebook and make it sharable using GitHub
- Use data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem.
- Use your data analysis tools to load a dataset, clean it, and find out interesting insights from it.
<br>
## **Collecting the data** <br>
In this lab, We will make a get request to the SpaceX API. We will also do some basic data wrangling and formating.<br>

- Request to the SpaceX API
- Clean the requested data
